#This file contains the 100-200 word feedback report based on the findings of part 1.

#Feedback:

1.	The error handling needs to be improved, when a user enter an invalid value for quantity, the program still prompt the user to capture the ingredient which is not stored. You should allow a user to only capture the quantity and move on.
2.	You need to create classes on the separate file not in the same file as the program.
3.	The display can be improved by putting headers and tab once.
4.	The readme file is not detailed enough to guide the user on how to execute the program, see a readme file as a user manual. (Put not more than 5 screenshots).

# How i have solved these issues
1) Error handling is more robust (see errorhandling.png) Specifically, quantity and calories.
2) Classes have been seperated into different files. Program.cs, Ingrediant.cs, RecipeBook.cs etc.
3) Display has been enhanced by using \n (Skip lines) and \t (tab) to create a better visual display
4) Readme file has been updated to include information on how to clone a repo and launch the program.

Thank you.
